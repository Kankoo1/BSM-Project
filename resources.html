        <h3>Purpose of Self-Management</h3>
        <p>There are four different ways that self-management can be used.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>People can utilize self-management to improve their quality of life.</li>
        <li>They can use self-management not to stop bad habits and start good habits.</li>
        <li>They can use self-management to complete challenging activities.</li>
        <li>They can also use self-management to achieve various goals.</li>
    </ol>
        <h3>Benefits of Self-Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Generalization and maintenance can more easily be achieved.</li>
            <li>Learning self-management techniques can generalize to a variety of behaviors.</li>
            <li>Another person doesn’t have to be involved with the person ALL the time to help them make positive changes.</li>
            <li>Self-management is a common expectation in everyday life including in an educational setting (at school), in the home (e.g. routines), and in the workplace.</li>
            <li>Self-management allows the person to have more “control” over their own life rather than having someone else always telling them what to do.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Self-management can include using both antecedent and consequence strategies.</p>   
        <p>Some examples of antecedent strategies used in self-management include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>manipulating motivating operations</li>
            <li>providing prompts</li>
            <li>performing the beginning of a behavior chain</li>
            <li>environmental arrangement (for instance, removing materials that are involved in the undesired behavior or setting up the environment with materials that are involved in the desired behavior)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some examples of consequence strategies used in self-management include:</p>
            <li>  providing reinforcement to the self for engaging in the target behavior</li>
            <li>using negative reinforcement or punishment if applicable</li>
            <li>  providing reinforcement to the self for engaging in the target behavior</li>
