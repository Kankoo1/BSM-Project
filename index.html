                Teamwork has many definitions:
            </p>
            <p>
                “<strong>Teamwork</strong> can be defined as the ability of team members to work together, communicate effectively, anticipate and meet each other's demands, and inspire confidence, resulting in a coordinated collective action” - International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioural Sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The process of working collaboratively with a group of people in order to achieve a goal. <strong>Teamwork</strong> is often a crucial part of a business, as it is often necessary for colleagues to work well together, trying their best in any circumstance. Teamwork means that people will try to cooperate, using their individual skills and providing constructive feedback, despite any personal conflict between individuals.” - BusinessDictionary.
